# Contribute to graphedexcel

Feel free to contribute by opening an issue or a pull request.

You can help with the following, that I have thought of so far:

- Add more tests
- Improve the code
- Add more features
- Improve the visualization and the ease of configuration
- Add graph analysis to localize bottle necks
- Add a way to determine computational complexity ie "what could slow calculations down?"-guesses
- Add more examples
- Add more documentation
